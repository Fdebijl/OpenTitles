OpenTitles is a browser addon that currently tracks changes to 26 Dutch news sites, such as NOS.nl and NU.nl and adds a button to the headlines on these sites. When clicked, this button will show all recent changes to the title of this article.

Although currently limited to Dutch sites, an update is underway that will add many more international news sites to the list. If you would like to contribute to this list, please check the [wiki](https://github.com/Fdebijl/OpenTitles/wiki) for instructions on formatting a news website for this list. If you can't be bothered to figure that out, you can simply click the extension icon when it's installed - a window will pop up with a form to suggest the website you're currently on should be tracked by OpenTitles.
